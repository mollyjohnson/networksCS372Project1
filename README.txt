Program Name: ClientServerChat
Program Description: ClientServerChat is my program for completing the requirements of the cs372 Project 1
Assignment. This program works basically as a chat program between a server on one host (A) and a client on
another host (B). A connection will be established between host A and host B, and the client
and server can send messages back and forth to one another until the user (who is controlling
both the client and server) requests to quit the program, at which point the connection will be closed.
